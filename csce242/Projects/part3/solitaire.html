        <p>Solitaire is a famous solo card gamethat requires a standard 52 playing card deck.
             The goal of the game is to get all the cards from the stock pile into the foundation piles. 
             There are several Solitaire variations like spider solitaire and Klondike solitaire. 
             While the different Solitaire game rules may change, most follow the same objective. 
             Cards and groups of cards, as well as individual cards from the stockpile, can be moved 
             in the tableau as long as they are moved on top of a card of a different color in descending rank.
