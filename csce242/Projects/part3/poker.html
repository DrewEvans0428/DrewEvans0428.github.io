            <p>Three kinds of Poker:</p>
        <p>1.Three Card Poker is a casino table game played with a standard 52-card deck.
             Players take on the dealer in a one-on-one match rather than competing against other players. A
             fter all ante wagers are placed, three cards are dealt to each player and the dealer. 
             Players have a choice to either fold or continue in the game by placing a "play" wager equal to their ante</p>
             <p>2. Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) 
                is one of the most popular variants of the card game of poker. Two cards, 
                known as hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community 
                cards are dealt face up in three stages.</p>
                <p>3.Omaha hold 'em (also known as Omaha holdem or simply Omaha) is a community card poker game similar to Texas hold 'em,
                     where each player is dealt four cards and must make their best hand using exactly two of them, plus exactly three of
                      the five community cards.</p>
