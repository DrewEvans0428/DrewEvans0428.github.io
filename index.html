        <h2>Problem Statement: Students Cramming In Work</h2>
        <p>A problem that I have for my problem statement and a problem I notice other students having is having all their work crammed in. 
          Who causes this issue? Students often mainly cause this own issue on themselves by procrastination, but it can also just be unlucky with your course load.
          Where? Most students cause this issue within their own head, making obstacles for themselves and telling themselves it will be harder. 
          This can be solved by students having an effective planner that keeps them in check.

            This affinity shows the brainstorming that goes into advertising our products. This includes
          advertising, expenses, ideas for the hardware, feedback, and platforms.
            Our first column gives our ideas for advertisement, our second covers what we need to use to spend, the third is our hardware ideas, the fourth is for collecting feedback about our products, and the fifth column is for choosing what platforms to use for purchasing and advertisement.
