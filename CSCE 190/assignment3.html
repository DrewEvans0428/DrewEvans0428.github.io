            This affinity shows the brainstorming that goes into advertising our products. This includes
          advertising, expenses, ideas for the hardware, feedback, and platforms.
            Our first column gives our ideas for advertisement, our second covers what we need to use to spend, the third is our hardware ideas, the fourth is for collecting feedback about our products, and the fifth column is for choosing what platforms to use for purchasing and advertisement.
